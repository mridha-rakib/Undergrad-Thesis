Mathematical modelling of information security policy compliance: An integration of the theory of planned behavior and the protection motivation theory.
# Abstract
Information security (IS) is subject to increasing dangers as technology is increasingly integrated to connect and share data with other devices and systems through the Internet. By safeguarding IS as a key information and intelligence asset, organizations may thereby gain a competitive edge. The theory of planned behavior (TPB) and the protection motive theory were two important theories that were used in this study to evaluate information systems security policy (ISSP) compliance (PMT). The proposed and approved research model combined elements of the aforementioned ideas. In order to test the conceptualization of the research, relevant hypotheses were generated. Two-stage analytical method (PLS and ANN technique) for hypothesis testing and validation of the proposed model. In the initial step, this thesis will create some hypotheses. Then drawing those relationships with a box and arrow. After that, it will test whether those relationships are significant with some additional analysis. PLS can test the hypothesized relationships. In the second step, ANN modeling will validate the PLS result. This will set the priority of each significant relationship so that this study will quickly determine the ISSP compliance behavioral intention. This study will use ANN because it performs traditional tools in detecting linear and non-linear relationships rather than just linear ones. This thesis demonstrated that variables like self-efficacy, attitude toward compliance, 
subjective norms, response efficacy, and perceived vulnerability positively influence employees' intentions to comply with ISSP behavioral standards. It did this by surveying 114 business managers and IS professionals. The data analysis as indicators of ISSP behavioural compliance intentions did not support perceived severity and response costs. There is a discussion of the study's ramifications for both research and practice
